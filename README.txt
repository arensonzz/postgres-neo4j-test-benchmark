InvoicingDBTestBench

This program is used to generate invoicing db related test data and executing query tests.

In order to repeat the tests used in the study MySQL 5.1.41, MariaDB 10.5.6 and Neo4J 4.1.3 need to be installed first.

After the databases have been installed, just run the main program.

The data files city_of_houston.csv, firstnames.csv, surnames.csv have been shortened to fit into GitHub.
